  <p>Hello everyone! I'm Liezl Lizardo, 46 years old, single and a member of Nueva Valencia Branch, Jordan Philippines District, and live in Island of Guimaras, Philippines. I'm presently working at our local hospital here in our province for almost 6 years and 13 years at Administrator's Office of Provincial Government of Guimaras. I love sports from basketball, volleyball and soccer lately. One of the talk l love the most was given by Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin,"Come what may and Love it", he counsel us to learn to laugh, seek eternal truth, increase our compassion and understanding towards others and Trust in the Father and the Son. Thus, we should trust in the Lord, do our best and leave the rest to Him.</p>
